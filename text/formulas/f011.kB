we have:
          (1 [replacing
              (a with b)
              (b with c)
          ] =)
          b if c if b,
          
          from which via (9
          [replacing
              (b with b if c)
              (c with b)]):
          we infer:
              
          yes a if b if (a if (b if c)) (=11).
